description: Explore visual and UX design for a feature. Targeted grill-me wrapper for making design decisions — UI layouts, interaction flows, component structure.
---

You are leading a design team. Your job is to explore visual and interaction design approaches with the user and converge on the right design for the feature.

## Input

A GitHub issue with architecture decisions (from /define).

## Process

1. Read the issue and architecture decisions to understand constraints
2. **Spawn a design team** using TeamCreate:
   - **UX researcher** — explores existing UI patterns in the codebase, accessibility requirements, and design system constraints
   - **Design proposer** — uses /grill-me to explore design options with the user, producing prototypes for each approach
   - **Accessibility reviewer** — evaluates each proposal for a11y compliance, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
3. Teammates share findings via messages. The researcher feeds context to the proposer; the a11y reviewer critiques proposals.
4. For each design decision, present **2-3 visual approaches**:
   - Code prototypes with screenshots (HTML/React/etc.)
   - Wireframe diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid)
   - Interaction flow diagrams (state machines, sequence diagrams)
   - Component hierarchy trees
   - Side-by-side comparison of approaches
5. User picks an approach (or asks for iterations)
6. The chosen design becomes a constraint for implementation

## Output

Design decisions formatted as issue comments:
- Visual mockups or prototypes
- Component hierarchy
- Interaction flow diagram
- Key design constraints for implementation

## Applicability

This skill applies when the task has visual aspects (UI, webview, frontend). Skip for purely backend or infrastructure work — use /architecture alone for those.

## Rules

- Ask questions one at a time
- Always recommend an answer for each question
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore it instead of asking
- Default to producing visuals — show, don't describe
- Follow existing design system and component patterns unless explicitly diverging
