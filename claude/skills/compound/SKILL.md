description: Capture learnings from completed work into durable, searchable solution docs. Invoke when the user says "it's fixed", "that worked", "working now", or explicitly via /compound — also after a non-trivial debugging session or implementation concludes successfully. Turns ephemeral knowledge into reusable artifacts in .claude/docs/solutions/.
---

You are leading the knowledge compounding phase. Your job is to capture what was just learned — the fix, the insight, the pattern — into a durable artifact that future agents and developers can discover and reuse.

## Input

The current conversation context — a completed debugging session, feature implementation, or fix.

## Process

### Mode Selection

Assess the complexity of what was just learned:

- **Lightweight** — simple fix, single root cause, no cross-cutting concerns. Single-pass extraction, no sub-agents.
- **Full** — multi-step debugging, non-obvious root cause, or pattern that applies broadly. Parallel sub-agents for thorough extraction.

Decision tree:
1. Is this a pattern others will hit? → Full
2. Did debugging involve multiple hypotheses or files? → Full
3. Was the fix a one-liner or config change with obvious cause AND unlikely to recur? → Lightweight
4. Is the user explicitly asking for a quick capture? → Lightweight

### Lightweight

Single-pass extraction. Work through these steps yourself:

1. Ensure `.claude/docs/solutions/` exists — create it if missing
2. Identify the problem and solution from the conversation history
3. Search `.claude/docs/solutions/` for existing docs with overlapping content (same module, component, or symptoms)
   - **High overlap** (same root cause or very similar symptoms) → update the existing doc instead of creating a new one
   - **Partial overlap** (related but distinct) → create new doc, add a "See also" link to the related doc
   - **No overlap** → create new doc
4. Write the solution doc (see Knowledge Tracks and Output Format below)
5. Verify discoverability: check if CLAUDE.md or project-level instructions mention `.claude/docs/solutions/`. If not, suggest adding a line like: `Check .claude/docs/solutions/ for known issues and patterns before debugging.` Do not modify CLAUDE.md automatically — present the suggestion to the user.

### Full

1. Ensure `.claude/docs/solutions/` exists — create it if missing

2. **Spawn a compounding team** using TeamCreate with three specialists:
   - **Context analyst** — reviews the full conversation history and git diff to extract: what broke, what was tried, what worked, and why
   - **Solution extractor** — distills the fix into a reusable pattern: root cause, solution steps, prevention guidance
   - **Overlap scanner** — searches `.claude/docs/solutions/` and project docs for existing coverage. Reports whether to create new or update existing:
     - **High overlap** (same root cause or very similar symptoms) → update the existing doc with new findings
     - **Partial overlap** (related but distinct) → create new doc, add a "See also" link to the related doc
     - **No overlap** → create new doc

3. Teammates share findings via messages. The overlap scanner's verdict determines whether we create or update.

4. Synthesize team findings into a solution doc.

5. Verify discoverability: check if CLAUDE.md or project-level instructions mention `.claude/docs/solutions/`. If not, suggest adding a line like: `Check .claude/docs/solutions/ for known issues and patterns before debugging.` Do not modify CLAUDE.md automatically — present the suggestion to the user.

## Output

### Knowledge Tracks

Choose the track that fits what was learned:

#### Bug Track
Use when the learning came from fixing a bug or unexpected behavior.

```markdown
## Problem
<!-- What went wrong — observable symptoms -->

## Symptoms
<!-- How it manifested — error messages, failing tests, user reports -->

## What Didn't Work
<!-- Approaches tried that failed — saves future debuggers time -->

## Solution
<!-- The actual fix — code changes, config changes, commands -->

## Why It Works
<!-- Root cause explanation — why the fix addresses the underlying issue -->

## Prevention
<!-- How to avoid this in the future — tests, linting rules, patterns -->
```

#### Knowledge Track
Use when the learning is a pattern, technique, or architectural insight.

```markdown
## Context
<!-- When this knowledge applies — project area, tech stack, situation -->

## Guidance
<!-- The insight or pattern — what to do -->

## Why
<!-- Rationale — why this approach over alternatives -->

## When to Use
<!-- Conditions that make this the right choice -->

## Examples
<!-- Concrete code examples or references -->
```

### Output Format

Create (or update) a Markdown file in `.claude/docs/solutions/` with this structure:

```markdown
---
problem_type: bug | pattern | config | performance | integration
module: <module or package name>
component: <specific component or class>
symptoms:
  - <observable symptom 1>
  - <observable symptom 2>
root_cause: <one-line root cause summary>
tags:
  - <tag1>
  - <tag2>
severity: low | medium | high | critical
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# <Descriptive Title>

<!-- Knowledge track content here (Bug Track or Knowledge Track) -->
```

File naming: `.claude/docs/solutions/<module>-<short-description>.md` (kebab-case).

## Rules

- Capture knowledge while it's fresh — don't defer
- Prefer updating existing docs over creating duplicates
- Keep solution docs concise — future readers want answers, not narratives
- Include actual error messages and stack traces in symptoms — these are what people search for
- Never include secrets, tokens, or credentials in solution docs
