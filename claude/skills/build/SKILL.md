description: Build a feature from a GitHub issue. Creates a git worktree, spawns a build team, and codes against the issue's acceptance criteria using TDD. Use after /define has produced approved architecture decisions.
---

You are leading the build phase. Your goal is to take a fully specified GitHub issue and produce working code.

## Input

A GitHub issue number (with architecture/design decisions from /define) and any additional resources.

## Process

1. Read the issue, all comments, and linked sub-issues to understand the full scope.

2. **Create a git worktree** for the feature (`git worktree add`). Worktrees keep the main workspace clean and let teammates operate in isolation.

3. **Spawn an implementation team** using TeamCreate:
   - Assign each teammate a separate sub-issue or file group to avoid conflicts
   - Teammates communicate peer-to-peer, share discoveries, and flag potential conflicts
   - The lead coordinates via the shared task list and merges results

4. Each teammate follows **test-driven development (TDD)** for logic-heavy code:
   - Write a failing test first — derive test cases from the acceptance criteria
   - Implement until the test passes — minimal code to satisfy the test
   - Refactor — clean up while tests stay green
   - Skip TDD for pure boilerplate/wiring

5. **Verify before marking done** — after completing each implementation task, pause and answer these 5 questions before committing:
   1. What side effects fire when this code runs? (events, webhooks, notifications, cache invalidation)
   2. Do tests exercise the real chain, not just mocks?
   3. Can failure leave orphaned state? (partial writes, dangling references, leaked resources)
   4. What other interfaces expose this? (API endpoints, CLI commands, UI components that call this)
   5. Do error handling strategies align across layers?
   This check is mandatory but does not require user approval to proceed. Always run it; fix any gaps it reveals before committing.

6. **Simplify as you go** — after every 2-3 task completions from the task list, do a quick consolidation scan:
   - Review files you just touched for obvious duplication, dead code, or consolidation opportunities
   - This is NOT a full refactor — just a fast scan for low-hanging improvements
   - If found, create a micro-task to consolidate before proceeding to the next implementation task
   - Keep it lightweight: "scan for obvious duplication in files you just touched"

7. Commit changes incrementally using semantic commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

## Output

A feature branch in a worktree with all acceptance criteria implemented, tests passing, and clean incremental commits. Ready for /review.

## Rules

- Use superpowers:test-driven-development for the TDD workflow
- Use worktrunk (`wt`) for worktree management
- Use TeamCreate for team coordination
- Do not ask the user whether to use teams — just use them
- Do not open a PR — that happens after /implement completes the full cycle
- Always run the 5-question verification check before marking a task done
- Consolidation scans are lightweight — spend seconds, not minutes
