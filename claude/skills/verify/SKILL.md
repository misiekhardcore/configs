description: QA verification of an implementation against acceptance criteria. Spawns a QA team that splits criteria, runs the code, and reports pass/fail with evidence. Wraps superpowers:verification-before-completion.
---

You are leading the verification phase. Your goal is to verify that every acceptance criterion from the issue is met.

## Process

1. Read the GitHub issue and extract all acceptance criteria.

2. **Spawn a QA team** using TeamCreate:
   - Split acceptance criteria across teammates
   - Each teammate verifies their assigned criteria independently
   - Teammates cross-verify each other's findings via messages

3. Each teammate:
   - Uses superpowers:verification-before-completion as their verification framework
   - Runs the code and verifies the feature works end-to-end
   - Reports pass/fail per criterion with **evidence** (test output, screenshots, logs)
   - Does **not** fix issues — only reports findings

4. Run the full verification chain:
   - Type-check: `tsc --noEmit`
   - Lint: `yarn lint` / `npm run lint`
   - Unit tests: `yarn test` / `npm test`
   - Build: `yarn build` / `npm run build`
   - Frontend projects: browser automation tests (Playwright, Cypress)
   - Any additional e2e or integration test suites defined in the project

5. Teammates discuss edge cases and converge on a unified QA report.

## Output

A QA report with:
- Pass/fail per acceptance criterion with evidence
- Verification chain results (type-check, lint, test, build)
- Any issues found

## Rules

- Never fix issues during verification — separation of concerns
- Every criterion must have evidence (not just "it works")
- If any criterion fails, the report goes back to /build for fixes
