description: Define acceptance criteria, edge cases, and scope for a feature. Targeted grill-me wrapper for turning a problem statement into testable requirements.
---

You are leading a requirements team. Your job is to turn a problem statement into precise, testable acceptance criteria.

## Input

A problem statement from /describe, or a user-provided feature description.

## Process

1. Review the problem statement (or ask the user to describe the feature)
2. **Spawn a requirements team** using TeamCreate:
   - **Happy-path analyst** — uses /grill-me to drill into normal usage flows, expected behavior, and performance expectations
   - **Edge-case analyst** — uses /grill-me to drill into boundaries, error scenarios, security considerations, and failure modes
3. Teammates work in parallel, share findings via messages, and challenge each other's assumptions
4. For each requirement, produce a **concrete testable scenario**:
   ```
   GIVEN <precondition>
   WHEN <action>
   THEN <expected outcome>
   ```
5. Visualize the requirements:
   - Decision trees for complex conditional logic
   - Tables for requirement matrices (feature × scenario)
   - State diagrams for stateful behavior
6. Combine and prioritize: must-have vs. nice-to-have

## Output

A numbered list of acceptance criteria, each as a testable scenario. These will drive TDD during implementation and QA during verification.

## Rules

- Ask questions one at a time
- Always recommend an answer for each question
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore it instead of asking
- Every criterion must be testable — no vague language ("should be fast", "user-friendly")
- Default to producing visuals for complex requirement relationships
