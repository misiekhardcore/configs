description: Review an implementation against its issue requirements. Spawns a review team — one for correctness, one for style/standards. Wraps superpowers:requesting-code-review with team-based specialist review.

You are leading the review phase. Your goal is to thoroughly review the implementation and produce actionable findings.

## Phase 0 — Scope Assessment

Before starting, classify the review scope:

1. **Lightweight** — small change, single file or tightly scoped fix
   - Single reviewer, quick pass. No team dispatch.
   - Focus on correctness and obvious issues only.
2. **Standard** — typical feature or multi-file change
   - 2 base reviewers + conditional specialists based on diff analysis.
3. **Deep** — security-sensitive, performance-critical, cross-cutting, or migration/breaking-change
   - All specialist reviewers active. Veto power for security/performance.

Decision tree:
1. Is the diff under ~50 lines and touches one module? → Lightweight
2. Does it touch auth/security, database migrations, public APIs, or performance-critical paths? → Deep
3. Otherwise → Standard

## Process

### Lightweight

1. Read the GitHub issue and its acceptance criteria.
2. Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes.
3. Single-pass review: check acceptance criteria, obvious bugs, leftover debug code, forgotten TODOs.
4. Report findings.

### Standard

1. Read the GitHub issue and its acceptance criteria.

2. **Analyze the diff** to determine which conditional reviewers to activate:
   - Run `git diff main...HEAD` and scan the output for domain-specific patterns
   - **Security reviewer** — activate when the diff touches authentication or authorization code (e.g., `auth`, `token`, `session`, `permission`). Require co-occurrence of 2+ security-related terms in the same file, OR file paths matching `**/auth/**`, `**/security/**`, `**/middleware/**`.
   - **Performance reviewer** — activate when the diff touches database queries or data access patterns (e.g., `query`, `findAll`, `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `index`). Trigger on file paths matching `**/db/**`, `**/queries/**` or database-related content — NOT on generic JS iteration methods like `forEach` or `map`.
   - **Migration reviewer** — activate when the diff includes schema changes or data migrations. Trigger on file paths matching `**/migrations/**`, `**/db/**` or content matching `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `addColumn`, `migration`.

3. **Spawn a review team** using TeamCreate with the base reviewers plus any activated conditional reviewers:
   - **Correctness reviewer** (always-on) — checks that the implementation satisfies every acceptance criterion, handles edge cases, and has no logical errors.
   - **Standards reviewer** (always-on) — checks code style, naming, patterns, test quality, and adherence to project conventions.
   - **Security reviewer** (conditional) — checks for authentication/authorization bugs, injection vulnerabilities, secret exposure, and unsafe data handling.
   - **Performance reviewer** (conditional) — checks for N+1 queries, unbounded loops, missing pagination, cache misses, and unindexed lookups.
   - **Migration reviewer** (conditional) — checks for backward compatibility, rollback safety, data loss risks, and migration ordering.

4. All reviewers work in parallel. Each reviewer:
   - Runs `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes
   - Checks for leftover debug code, forgotten TODOs, or accidental changes
   - Uses superpowers:requesting-code-review as their review framework
   - Reports findings as a structured list with **confidence scoring**:
     ```
     - file:line | issue title | severity (P0-P3) | confidence (0.0-1.0)
     ```
   - Confidence calibration:
     - 0.9+ = would bet on this being a real bug
     - 0.7–0.9 = likely an issue but needs verification
     - 0.5–0.7 = suspicious but could be intentional

5. **Merge and deduplicate findings** across all reviewers:
   - Group findings by file + line_bucket (±3 lines) + normalized title (lowercase, strip trailing punctuation, collapse whitespace)
   - When 2+ reviewers flag the same issue, boost confidence by 0.10 (clamp to 1.0)
   - Suppress findings below the confidence thresholds defined in Rules
   - Merge duplicates into a single finding, noting which reviewers flagged it
   - Suppressed findings are listed in a collapsed "Low-confidence observations" section at the end of the report

6. Reviewers discuss disagreements via messages and converge on a unified review.

7. Present findings to the implementation lead. Do **not** fix issues — only report them.

### Deep

1. Read the GitHub issue and its acceptance criteria.

2. **Spawn an extended review team** using TeamCreate with all specialists active:
   - **Correctness reviewer** — checks acceptance criteria, edge cases, logical errors
   - **Standards reviewer** — checks code style, naming, patterns, test quality
   - **Security reviewer** — checks for vulnerabilities: injection, auth bypass, data exposure, insecure defaults, OWASP top 10 concerns
   - **Performance/migration reviewer** — checks for N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, breaking changes, migration safety, backward compatibility

3. All reviewers work in parallel. Each uses `git diff main...HEAD` and reports structured findings with confidence scoring (same format and calibration as Standard mode).

4. **Merge and deduplicate** — same process as Standard mode.

5. Team converges on a unified review via messages.

6. Present findings to the implementation lead. Do **not** fix issues — only report them.

## Output

A structured review report with:
- Pass/fail per acceptance criterion
- Issues found (with file:line references, severity, and confidence score)
- Which conditional reviewers were activated and why (Standard) or note that all were active (Deep)
- Recommendations

## Rules

- Never fix issues during review — separation of concerns
- All reviewers must agree before the review is finalized
- All reviewers can block on Critical findings. In Deep mode, security and performance reviewers additionally block on High-severity findings.
- Flag any changes outside the stated scope of the issue
- Confidence below 0.60 means suppress (0.50 for P0/Critical)
- Always run the merge/dedup step — never present raw duplicates to the user
