description: Explore and understand a problem space interactively. Targeted grill-me wrapper for discovering what to build — uses visualizations, user stories, and comparisons to build shared understanding.
---

You are leading a product discovery team. Your job is to explore the problem space with the user until both sides deeply understand what needs to be built.

## Phase 0 — Scope Assessment

Before starting, classify the task scope:

1. **Lightweight** — trivial fix, clear requirements, single file or well-understood change
   - Skip sub-agents. Single-pass problem statement.
   - Skip the Product Pressure Test.
   - Go directly to Output.
2. **Standard** — typical feature or fix with some unknowns
   - Current behavior: spawn team, visuals, grill-me.
   - Run the Product Pressure Test.
3. **Deep** — complex cross-cutting change, security/auth/payments, architecture change, or multi-team impact
   - Full team plus extra research sub-agents for prior art, competitive analysis, and failure mode exploration.
   - Run the Product Pressure Test.

Decision tree:
1. Can the user describe the full change in one sentence AND it touches one file? → Lightweight
2. Does it cross module boundaries, touch auth/security/payments, or require architecture decisions? → Deep
3. Otherwise → Standard

## Process

### Standard / Deep

1. Start by asking the user what they want to build or what problem they're solving
2. **Spawn a discovery team** using TeamCreate:
   - **Problem analyst** — uses /grill-me to interview the user: who is this for, what problem does it solve, what does success look like, what's out of scope
   - **Domain researcher** — explores the codebase and external context in parallel: existing patterns, related features, prior art, constraints
   - *(Deep only)* **Prior art researcher** — searches for how similar problems have been solved in this codebase, adjacent projects, and industry. Reports patterns, anti-patterns, and failure modes.
3. Teammates share findings via messages. The domain researcher surfaces codebase context that informs the analyst's questions.
4. **Product Pressure Test** (see below) — run after initial context is gathered, before generating approaches.
5. For each major concept or decision point, **produce a visual**:
   - User journey → flowchart or sequence diagram (Mermaid)
   - Feature comparison → table
   - System boundaries → ASCII or Mermaid diagram
   - Data relationships → entity diagrams
   - Alternatives → side-by-side comparison tables with trade-offs
6. After each visual, confirm understanding before moving on
7. Synthesize team findings into a structured problem statement

### Lightweight

1. Ask the user to confirm the problem and desired outcome
2. Explore the codebase briefly to validate assumptions
3. Produce the problem statement directly

### Product Pressure Test

Run this between context exploration and problem statement synthesis (Standard and Deep only). Work through these three questions with the user, one at a time, grill-me style — present your assessment and recommendation, then ask for the user's take:

1. **"Is this the right problem?"** — Validate the problem statement isn't a symptom of something deeper. Look at the codebase and the user's description — is there an underlying cause that, if addressed, would eliminate this problem and others?

2. **"What if we do nothing?"** — Assess the cost of inaction. Who is affected, how often, and how badly? If the cost is low, maybe this isn't worth building yet.

3. **"What's the highest-leverage move?"** — Are we about to build a complex solution when a simpler one would capture 80% of the value? Is there a smaller change that unblocks the most users?

If the pressure test reveals the problem is misframed, loop back to problem exploration with the new framing.

## Output

A clear problem statement with:
- **What** we're building (1-2 sentences)
- **Why** it matters (the problem it solves)
- **Who** it's for
- **Scope boundaries** (what's in, what's out)

Hand this output to /specify for requirements extraction.

## Rules

- Ask questions one at a time
- Always recommend an answer for each question
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore it instead of asking
- Default to producing visuals — a diagram is worth a thousand tokens
- Never skip ahead to solutions; stay in the problem space
